• Developed a C++ application to simulate the complete data processing pipeline of a firmware system for an analog sensor.

• Designed a voltage divider circuit in LTSpice to model an NTC thermistor, generating realistic analog sensor data that reflects various thermal conditions.

• Implemented core firmware logic including file parsing, Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC), and a moving average filter for digital signal smoothing and noise reduction.

• Applied threshold-based decision logic to the clean, filtered data to classify the system's operational status (e.g., Nominal, Warning, Critical), demonstrating a full-cycle, hardware-to-decision simulation.
